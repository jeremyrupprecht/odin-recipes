    <h2> Description </h2>

    <p>This peri peri chicken recipe features a great spicy marinade for an African dish that's great for a barbecue. 
        Nice with salad and fries, but I like adding it to a pita with salad and garlic Greek yogurt (3/4 cup Greek yogurt and 3 cloves of
        crushed garlic with finely chopped chives). Don't go on a date, though; it gives you wicked garlic breath!</p>
