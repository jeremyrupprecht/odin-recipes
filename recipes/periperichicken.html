    <h2> Description </h2>

    <p>This peri peri chicken recipe features a great spicy marinade for an African dish that's great for a barbecue. 
        Nice with salad and fries, but I like adding it to a pita with salad and garlic Greek yogurt (3/4 cup Greek yogurt and 3 cloves of
        crushed garlic with finely chopped chives). Don't go on a date, though; it gives you wicked garlic breath!</p>

    <h2> Ingredients </h2>

    <ul>
        <li>1 cup fresh lemon juice</li>
        <li>1/4 cup paprika</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons hot chili powder</li>
        <li>3 cloves garlic, minced</li>
        <li>1 & 1/2 teaspoons chopped fresh ginger</li>
        <li>1 & 1/2 teaspoons salt</li>
        <li>4 bone-in chicken breast halves</li>
    </ul>

    <h2> Steps </h2>

    <ol> 
        <li>Stir together lemon juice, paprika, chili powder, garlic, ginger, and salt in a large bowl until well combined.</li>
        <li>Add chicken; rub until well coated and marinate in the refrigerator for 3 hours.</li>
        <li>Preheat a grill for medium heat and lightly oil the grates.</li>
        <li>Place chicken onto the preheated grill; discard marinade. Cook, turning occasionally, until skins are slightly charred and the juices run clear.</li>
        <li>After about 30 minutes. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center of chicken should read at least 165 degrees F (74 degrees C). At this point the chicken is done!</li>
    </ol>
